# Kanji-Kounter
Kanji-Kounter is a Python tool that checks EPUB files and gives the user information about Kanji-frequency, the total amound of Kanji and the number of unique Kanji in the file. It's for Japanese learners that want to figure out how hard a book is before diving into it

## Required libraries (for the .py)
[ebooklib](https://pypi.org/project/EbookLib/)

**In some cases, you might also need to install [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html). On most systems, tkinter is included in the standard library.**

## Use-case example

If you don't have python or don't want to bother with the terminal, just run the .exe

## Security concern
Windows sometimes falsely detects the .exe as a virus, even tho it's safe, you can check the source-code if you're a bit paranoid :)
