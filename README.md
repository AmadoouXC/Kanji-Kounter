# Kanji-Kounter
Kanji-Kounter is a Python tool that checks EPUB files and gives the user information about Kanji-frequency, the total amound of Kanji and the number of unique Kanji in the file. It's handy for Japanese learners to figure out how hard a book is before diving into it!

How to Use

Before running Kanji-Kounter, ensure you have Python installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website: Python Downloads

Next, you'll need to install the required libraries. Open your terminal or command prompt and use pip to install the necessary libraries:

pip install ebooklib
pip install regex

In some cases, you might also need to install tkinter separately. On most systems, tkinter is included in the standard library. However, if you encounter any issues with the GUI, you can install it using the following:

pip install tk

Running the Program

To use Kanji-Kounter, simply run the KanjiKounter.py script using Python:

python KanjiKounter.py

The GUI window will open, allowing you to browse and analyze EPUB files for kanji characters.
