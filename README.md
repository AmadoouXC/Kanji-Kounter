# Kanji-Kounter
Kanji-Kounter is a Python tool that analyzes EPUB files to provide information about the number of kanji characters in the text. This tool can be helpful for Japanese learners who want to assess the complexity of a book before reading it. It gives learners an idea of how many kanji characters they may encounter in the text, helping them determine if the book is suitable for their current learning level.
Features

    Count the total number of kanji characters in the EPUB file.
    Display the number of unique kanji characters used in the text.
    Show the frequency of each kanji character in descending order.

How to Use

    Clone or download the Kanji-Kounter repository to your local machine.

    Make sure you have Python and the required packages (ebooklib, re) installed.

    Run the Kanji-Kounter script with the following command:

    python KanjiKounter.py

    The program will prompt you to select an EPUB file to analyze. Click the "Browse" button and choose the EPUB file you want to analyze.

    After selecting the file, click the "Analyze" button, and the program will display the results in the text area.

    The results will include the total number of kanji characters, the number of unique kanji characters, and a list of kanji characters sorted by frequency.

    Use the information to assess the difficulty of the book in terms of kanji characters and decide if it matches your Japanese learning level.
